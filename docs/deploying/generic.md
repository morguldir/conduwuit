## Installing conduwuit

You may simply download the binary that fits your machine. Run `uname -m` to see what you need.

Prebuilt fully static musl binaries can be downloaded from the latest tagged release [here](https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit/releases/latest) or `main` CI branch workflow artifact output. These also include Debian packages. These binaries have jemalloc and io_uring statically linked and included with them.

Alternatively, you may compile the binary yourself. We recommend using [Lix](https://lix.systems) to build conduwuit as this has the most guaranteed
reproducibiltiy and easiest to get a build environment and output going.

Otherwise, follow standard Rust project build guides (installing git and cloning the repo, getting the Rust toolchain via rustup, installing LLVM toolchain + libclang for RocksDB, installing liburing for io_uring and RocksDB, etc).

## Adding a conduwuit user

While conduwuit can run as any user it is better to use dedicated users for different services. This also allows
you to make sure that the file permissions are correctly set up.

In Debian or Fedora/RHEL, you can use this command to create a conduwuit user:

```bash
sudo adduser --system conduwuit --group --disabled-login --no-create-home
```

For distros without `adduser`:

```bash
sudo useradd -r --shell /usr/bin/nologin --no-create-home conduwuit
```

## Forwarding ports in the firewall or the router

conduwuit uses the ports 443 and 8448 both of which need to be open in the firewall.

If conduwuit runs behind a router or in a container and has a different public IP address than the host system these public ports need to be forwarded directly or indirectly to the port mentioned in the config.

## Setting up a systemd service

The systemd unit for conduwuit can be found [here](../configuration/examples.md#example-systemd-unit-file). You may need to change the `ExecStart=` path to where you placed the conduwuit binary.

## Creating the conduwuit configuration file

Now we need to create the conduwuit's config file in `/etc/conduwuit/conduwuit.toml`. The example config can be found at [conduwuit-example.toml](../configuration/examples.md).**Please take a moment to read it. You need to change at least the server name.**

RocksDB is the only supported database backend.

## Setting the correct file permissions

If you are using a dedicated user for conduwuit, you will need to allow it to read the config. To do that you can run this:

```bash
sudo chown -R root:root /etc/conduwuit
sudo chmod -R 755 /etc/conduwuit
```

If you use the default database path you also need to run this:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/conduwuit/
sudo chown -R conduwuit:conduwuit /var/lib/conduwuit/
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/conduwuit/
```

## Setting up the Reverse Proxy

Refer to the documentation or various guides online of your chosen reverse proxy software. A [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) example will be provided as this is the recommended reverse proxy for new users and is very trivial to use (handles TLS, reverse proxy headers, etc transparently with proper defaults).

Lighttpd is not supported as it seems to mess with the `X-Matrix` Authorization header, making federation non-functional. If using Apache, you need to use `nocanon` to prevent this.

### Caddy

Create `/etc/caddy/conf.d/conduwuit_caddyfile` and enter this (substitute for your server name).

```caddy
your.server.name, your.server.name:8448 {
        # TCP
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:6167

        # UNIX socket
        #reverse_proxy unix//run/conduwuit/conduwuit.sock
}
```

That's it! Just start and enable the service and you're set.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now caddy
```

## You're done

Now you can start conduwuit with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start conduwuit
```

Set it to start automatically when your system boots with:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable conduwuit
```

## How do I know it works?

You can open [a Matrix client](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients), enter your homeserver and try to register.

You can also use these commands as a quick health check (replace `your.server.name`).

```bash
$ curl https://your.server.name/_conduwuit/server_version

# If using port 8448
$ curl https://your.server.name:8448/_conduwuit/server_version
```

- To check if your server can talk with other homeservers, you can use the [Matrix Federation Tester](https://federationtester.matrix.org/).
  If you can register but cannot join federated rooms check your config again and also check if the port 8448 is open and forwarded correctly.

## Audio/Video calls

For Audio/Video call functionality see the [TURN Guide](../turn.md).

## Appservices

If you want to set up an appservice, take a look at the [Appservice Guide](../appservices.md).
